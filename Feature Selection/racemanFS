#Proposed feature selection using metamorphic relations
#First, install the required packages if you haven't already:
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("caret")

#Now, you can load the libraries and proceed with the code:
# Load required libraries
library(dplyr)
library(caret)

# Function to identify patterns and correlations (placeholder)
IdentifyPatterns <- function(dataset) {
  # Perform an in-depth analysis to identify patterns and correlations
  correlation_matrix <- cor(OSN dataset)
  return(correlation_matrix)
}

# Function to define metamorphic relations (placeholder)
DefineMetamorphicRelations <- function(patterns) {
  # Define metamorphic relations based on patterns and correlations
  return(list(relation1 = "placeholder", relation2 = "placeholder"))  # Placeholder
}

# Function to select features based on metamorphic relations (placeholder)
SelectFeatures <- function(dataset, metamorphic_relations) {
  # Select features based on metamorphic relations
  selected_features <- names(dataset)  # Placeholder, select all features
  return(selected_features)
}

# Main function for proposed feature selection using metamorphic relations
feature_selection_MR <- function(dataset) {
  
  # Step 1: Perform an in-depth analysis to identify patterns and correlations
  patterns <- IdentifyPatterns(dataset)
  print("Patterns and Correlations:")
  print(patterns)
  
  # Step 2: Define metamorphic relations based on patterns and correlations
  metamorphic_relations <- DefineMetamorphicRelations(patterns)
  print("Metamorphic Relations:")
  print(metamorphic_relations)
  
  # Step 3: Select features based on metamorphic relations
  selected_features <- SelectFeatures(dataset, metamorphic_relations)
  print("Selected Features:")
  print(selected_features)
  
  return(list(Patterns = patterns, MetamorphicRelations = metamorphic_relations, SelectedFeatures = selected_features))
}

# OSN dataset (Replace this with your actual OSN dataset)
dataset <- data.frame(
  feature1 = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
  feature2 = c(5, 4, 3, 2, 1),
  feature3 = c(2, 2, 2, 2, 2)
)

# Run the proposed feature selection using metamorphic relations
result <- feature_selection_MR(dataset)

# Display the results (already displayed within the function)
