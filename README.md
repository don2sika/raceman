## Introduction

RACEMAN is a research project aimed at developing a robust and adaptive intrusion detection system for Online Social Networks (OSNs). The project employs a variety of machine learning algorithms, feature selection techniques, and metamorphic relations to achieve high accuracy and low computational overhead.

## Features

- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Selection using Metamorphic Relations
- Classification Algorithms
- Collaborative and Distributed IDS
- Performance Evaluation Metrics

## Installation

Please refer to the `INSTALL.md` for detailed installation instructions.

## Usage

To run the RACEMAN model in R, execute the following command:

source("run_raceman.R")

## Algorithms

- Data Cleaning Algorithm
- Data Preprocessing Algorithm
- Training and Testing of RACEMAN
- Feature Selection using Metamorphic Relations
- Classification Algorithm using RACEMAN
- Collaborative and Distributed IDS

## Evaluation Metrics

- Specificity
- Precision
- F-Measure
- Accuracy
- Sensitivity (Recall)
- G-Mean
- Fall-out (False Positive Rate)
- FNR (False Negative Rate)
- AUC (Area Under the Curve)
- Detection Rate (DR)
- Time to Detect (TTD)
- System Overhead
- Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)

## Results

The evaluation results indicate that RACEMAN outperforms other machine learning models in terms of accuracy, precision, and computational overhead. Detailed results can be found in the `RESULTS.md` file.

## Threats to Validity

We have identified four main types of validity threats: internal, external, construct, and conclusion. For more details, refer to the `VALIDITY.md` file.

## Future Research

1. Expanding Dataset Diversity
2. Real-world Deployment
3. Adaptive Learning for New Threats
